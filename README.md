# FinalProject

Hello! Welcome to my final project for Creative Coding I.
I created a game inspired by Flappy Bird called "Pokemon Peril!".
To start the game, click the mouse button.
Continue clicking the mouse button to keep your Pokemon afloat.
Do not touch the pillars and do not hit the ground - or it's game over!
There are 3 Levels and each features a different Pokemon with a matching background.
Your points will accumulate at the top left of the screen.
Earn 15 points and you win!
